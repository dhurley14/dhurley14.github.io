Background Motivation
---------------------


I began this experiment with topic analysis on a friend's suggestion on utilizing the treasure trove that is twitter.
Marc Andreessen retweets a ton of different people all the time.  It's impossible to keep up with what those people's interests are.
I wanted to learn what exactly are the "Top Ten Things" that Marc Andreessen retweets, and how does he feel about these topics?
<!-- more -->

As we all know, a retweet basically widdles down to agreeing with the tweet's author.  This is where I decided to begin
researching topic analysis with Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

The first part of this blog series will cover a review of how I acquired the twitter data and the steps I took to get the the top
ten topics pmarca retweets.  The second part of this blog series will cover sentiment analysis on the tweets that are associated
with each topic.  Thus giving us an overview of how Marc Andreessen feels about specific topics he tweets about, based on people he 
retweets.

I HOPE THIS SHOWS UP.
