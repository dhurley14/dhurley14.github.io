##Background Motivation
Oil prices have been falling dramatically.  Oil prices are now at 40% of what they started FY 2014 off.
The fall in oil prices has been a result of increasing oil production in the United States and 
softening global demand.  Falling oil prices are part of a global phenomenon of deflation.  
The United States is far off the Federal Reserve's goal of 2% inflation (currently up 0.7% in December 2014 from a year earlier).
