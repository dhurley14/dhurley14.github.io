# How Bitcoin Works

So I recently finished reading / taking notes on a [blog post](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/) from Michael Nielsen.
In it he builds up the ideas of the block chain from basic principles.  He goes over the specifics of the Bitcoin block chain but the 
theory is applicable to other networks such as Ethereum. 

An understanding of how both [public key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and [digital signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature#Definition) work is pretty necessary to truly understand everything in the blog post.
  The Wikipedia pages for these concepts are fairly comprehensive and don't take much time to absorb the general ideas, which is all you really need for Nielsen's post.

If you have been interested in how block chain technology works, along with the underlying concepts that make up the block chain, I would highly suggest this blog post.
