## Examining WSJ Articles

I grew an interest in economics (specifically macro economic policy, labor economics and, for fun, commodity prices) during college. 
After taking a few economics courses from a very influential and brilliant professor I kept my eye on the wall street journal.
I believe it to be a reputable and low cost source of information.  Reading it everyday has helped me keep a reading on the health of 
the American and global economies and their interactions.  This blog post will hopefully be the first of many to come this summer
where I examine the implications of an article in the WSJ.

I enjoy the narratives that some of the articles in the WSJ can provide.  Weaving a story of economics is akin to weaving a tale
of global history, presently.  History was always an interest of mine and I find trying to build these stories of how certain,
little things such as the price of wheat and cocoa can ultimately affect oil prices, and how these affect policy decisions.
Such policy decisions are often the precursors to famously recorded moments in time.  

The article I will be looking at tonight is one that struck me as a reason to begin blogging about this. *Don't Count on Happy Returns for U.S. Stocks* by E.S. Browning 
examines how David Kostin of Goldman Sachs analyzed the performance of the S&P500 and his extrapolations.  Mr. Kostin's analysis is on the frugal side of performance
analyses but, according to the article, most money managers agree that the future of stock returns is not expected to be as fruitful as they have been as investment vehicles in the past.
Stocks are simply getting too expensive to continue producing these gains.  "The S&P 500 rose 32% in 2013 and 14% in 2014 (counting dividends)."  These returns are 
coming to their end.  (Maybe a good angle for this article would be to analyze how exponential distributions, the top 10% of buckets contain more than half of the total information available in the entire dataset?).
