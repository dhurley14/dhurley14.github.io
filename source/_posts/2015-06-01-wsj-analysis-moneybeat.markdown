## Examining WSJ Articles

I grew an interest in economics (specifically macro economic policy, labor economics and, for fun, commodity prices) during college. 
After taking a few economics courses from a very influential and brilliant professor I kept my eye on the wall street journal.
I believe it to be a reputable and low cost source of information.  Reading it everyday has helped me keep a reading on the health of 
the American and global economies and their interactions.  This blog post will hopefully be the first of many to come this summer
where I examine the implications of an article in the WSJ.

I enjoy the narratives that some of the articles in the WSJ can provide.  Weaving a story of economics is akin to weaving a tale
of global history, presently.  History was always an interest of mine and I find trying to build these stories of how certain,
little things such as the price of wheat and cocoa can ultimately affect oil prices, and how these affect policy decisions.
Such policy decisions are often the precursors to famously recorded moments in time.  

The article I will be looking at tonight is one that struck me as a reason to begin blogging about this. *Don't Count on Happy Returns for U.S. Stocks* by E.S. Browning 
examines stuff.
