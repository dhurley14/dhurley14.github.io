My name is Devin Hurley and I started this blog to play around with 
machine learning models that I found interesting.  However this was 
not my only interest and so you can find posts ranging from Linear Algebra, 
Economics, and random lessons and hacks I pick up.  If you ever have 
questions or just want to talk feel free to reach out to me over email at snowmiser111 at gmail.
