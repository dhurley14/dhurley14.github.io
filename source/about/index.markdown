My name is Devin Hurley and I started this blog to play around with 
Machine Learning models that I find interesting.  This blog might involve some
math but mostly just applying the models to answer questions.  If you ever
have questions or just want to talk feel free to reach out to me over email at
snowmiser111 at gmail.
