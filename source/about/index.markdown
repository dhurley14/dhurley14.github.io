My name is Devin Hurley and I started this blog to play around with 
machine learning models that I find interesting.  Throughout my college career
as a Computer Science major I was interested in the intersection of math and 
computer science.  After falling in love with Linear Algebra and it's
applications ( this love for linear algebra stemmed from [jeremykun](http://jeremykun.com/)'s 
explanation of the PageRank algorithm). This blog will involve some
math but mostly I will just be applying the models to answer questions.  
If you ever have questions or just want to talk feel free to reach out to 
me over email at snowmiser111 at gmail.
